--- I later found a recursive solution to the problem
--- I understand the solution BUT I couldnt get the data represtation right
--- If you run the function below, it will run for the proper number of steps
--- But have the wrong data lol :(
--- I need to rewrite performMove for this to work completely

-- Assuming 3 poles
-- Given the number of disks
-- List all of the steps that move the disks from the source pole to target pole
-- No smaller disk can be on top of a larger disk
-- Initial state [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [], []]
-- moveDisks :: Int -> [[[Int]]]

loadDisks :: Int -> [Int]
loadDisks 0 = []
loadDisks n
  | n < 0 = []
  | otherwise = [1..n]

-- Thereâ€™s a classic recursive solution: move the top (N-1) disks to the spare tower, 
-- then move the large bottom disk to the target tower, 
-- then finally move those (N-1) disk from the spare tower to the target tower.
